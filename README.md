## Introduction
[**Madrid**](https://goo.gl/maps/TBdfX8Gsz7YmFEUf6) is the capital and most populous city of Spain. The city has almost 3.4 million inhabitants and a metropolitan area population of approximately 6.7 million. It is the second-largest city in the European Union (EU), and its monocentric metropolitan area is the second-largest in the EU. The municipality covers 604.3 km2 geographical area.

Madrid is a center of attraction, the largest urban agglomeration on the Iberian Peninsula and a decisive engine of the Spanish economy with a lot of social dynamism. The city is not only the traditional political center of Spain, with parks and boulevards, but also a true metropolis in terms of culture, entertainment, sports, business and gastronomy. For example, it is home to two of the best soccer teams in the world. This makes Madrid attractive not only to institutional investors, but also to people looking for both the profitability of an investment and to enjoy the cityâ€™s impressive cultural, gastronomic and leisure offer.
